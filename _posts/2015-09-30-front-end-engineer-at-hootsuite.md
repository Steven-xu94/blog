I learned so much during my coop at Hootsuite Campaigns UX team. I basically refactored everything behind this website using cutting edge technologies that I learned. Yes, I love learning new technologies and playing with them to see what I can make.

<style>
blockquote {
  background: #f9f9f9;
  border-left: 10px solid #ccc;
  margin: 1.5em 10px;
  padding: 0.5em 10px;
  quotes: "\201C""\201D""\2018""\2019";
}

blockquote:before {
  color: #ccc;
  content: open-quote;
  font-size: 4em;
  line-height: 0.1em;
  margin-right: 0.25em;
  vertical-align: -0.4em;
}
blockquote p {
  display: inline;
  font-style: normal;
  letter-spacing: normal;

}

</style>

My manager wrote this on my coop evaluation:

<blockquote><p>
Steven has produced excellent work and has integrated into the team extremely well. His work on the image editor javascript plugin is going to be used throughout Hootsuite's code base. Steven always sought out more work when needed and always requested feedback from his peers.

Steven has had a demonstrable positive impact on the Hootsuite Campaigns product. 
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
At times Steven can be quiet in a group or while presenting but his overall communication skills are excellent.
</p></blockquote>

I have written a summary of my overall experience on the Hootsuite Engineering blog.
