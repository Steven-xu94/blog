Working at Ontario Institute for Cancer Research was really a rewarding experience. I really enjoyed working there, and appreciate that the team provided a platform for learning valuable and high quality technologies and experiences. I received an **outstanding** evaluation, which I am really thankful.

My manager wrote this on my coop evaluation:

Here is a wordle that summarizes what I did.

As it can be seen, I did more testing than developing. That was because I didn't have that much time to, for example, learn (from scratch) BackboneJS good enough to keep up with the work in an effective way. However, I did learn a lot by reading massive amount of code. When I did testing, not only did I finish my tasks quickly, but also I looked at the SVN logs to see what was changed and how that bug was solved. When I don't understand what was happening, I usually asked the developers "What does that mean, why did you change it to that?". <strong>Eventually, I was able to try a fix on my local copy, and if it worked, left a comment on JIRA saying, "This problem is because ..., and doing ... can fix it</strong>". I found that reading other's code is really a nice way to learn technology.

<br>
I also had opportunity to work on a number of <strong>side projects that are very interesting and challenging at times</strong>. I:

- developed an screenshot automation tool which receives tasks from MySQL database and process it with Jenkins
- developed prototype websites from a given mockup picture
- helped migrate from svn to git, using a self-hosting GitLab server
- investigated Vagrant and the cool things it can do
- investigated OwnCloud which allows sharing data between team members in nearly unlimited disk space
- extended the OAuth clients which are used to test against our internal and JIRA REST APIs
- maintained drupal websites, including updating the Drupal core

<br>
My manager invited me to attend the <strong>[Toronto Full Stack developer conference](http://fsto.co/)</strong>! And it was such a treat for me. I got exposed to so many exciting demos on cutting-edge tools that I currently don't understand (lol). This motivates my interest in becoming a front-end developer a lot.

<br>
My manager gave me opportunity to attend major meetings where managers, stakeholders and people with even higher positions discussed features and future directions of our products. <strong>Sometimes I was the "driver" of the meeting</strong>, who helped presenting the products live to the stakeholders. In addition to taking notes, my focus was on <strong>observing and learning how my manager behaved under such occasion</strong>. Specifically, I noticed that his presentation slides were styled in a very clean and clear way with professional font and animation choices; his wordings were always precise and formal while not losing any humour; when there were unexpected errors during the presentation, he acted calmly, carefully documented the problems, explained what he thought was happened, made a promise to his audiences and moved on. I would imagine being panic, awkward and embarrassed if I were him.

<br>
To conclude, I really appreciate working at OICR and am really thankful for everything that I have experienced. Right now, I would love to keep my career path as a web developer, preferably a front-end developer who actually does coding more.
